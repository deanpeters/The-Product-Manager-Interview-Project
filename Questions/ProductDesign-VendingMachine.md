# Vending Machine Innovations
> "Design a vending machine 2.0.  What are some big, innovative changes you can bring to vending machines and the vending machine industry to really disrupt the market"

> Note 1: I say "innovative", "disruptive", "big" multiple times intentionally to really reinforce the idea that they should be thinking outside the box here.

> Note 2: Moments of silence are ok, as is asking "OK, what else"?  They may start with some very simple things, but may blossom if you give them the space.

## Reason
### Hypothesis
> Product Managers need to innovate, not just iterate.  Can the candidate ideate quickly - thinking broad and deep about multiple different aspects of products.

### Measure of Success/Failure 
1. The candidate thinks broad:
  * Disrupting the business model
  * Changes to supply/distribution model of machines and/or goods in vending machines
  * Changes to goods in machines, or ways goods are stored or prepared or created
  * Changes to UI to interface with machines (perhaps via phones or other)
  * Changes to payment methods
  * Thoughts on value of data (communication between machines, communication to customers, communication to mother ship)
  * other?
2. The candidate thinks deep:
  * For any or all of the above, candidate comes up with multiple divergent paths, but can speak to pros and cons / values and limitations.
3. The candidate is excited by the exercise, not overwhelmed/stumped by it.

## Attributions
* Shannon derived this from classic Microsoft/Google questions of "Design an X".  I'm sure others have asked the same thing before - not revolutionary, but as with most questions, it's the journey that matters.
