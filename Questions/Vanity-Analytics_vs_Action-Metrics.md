> between Vanity Metrics vs. Actionable Analytics.

### Measure of Success/Failure 
1. While a candidate may not have actual encounters vanity metrics nor chances to employ actional analytics, the would fail as qualified if they cannot at least articulate the difference.
2. A candidate who successfully understands the differences might cite the following as vanity metrics:
   * an online newspaper that boasts of 100,000 raw page views per week
   * a search engine could be reporting 1,000,000 searches per month
   * a Facebook page that boasts of 10,000 registered followers
3. A candidate who successfully understands the differences might explain that actional analytics are:
   * Actionable - Actionable metrics tell the story of what action needs to be taken to meet your goals. The gold standard for actionable metrics is the results of A/B testing. Conversion are similarly a standard meeasure in ecommerce settings.
   * Accessible - A smart metric needs to be accessible to pretty much everyone: precise enough for the technical team, visual enough for marketing, and grounded in real-world behavior for any member of your team to understand.
   * Auditable - Auditable metrics mean that ideally any member of your team could find the source data and reproduce your report. 
4. Bonus points if they use this question as an opportunity to move the conversation in the direction of Lean.
